A tiny phaser game about getting yourself on the throne

## Central Story
You play as one of three characters trying to ascend to the throne of Essia
- Arabella Delafontaine
- Abbington Damon-Cowles
- Maximilian Covington

You're technically next in line and you're the obvious choice, but there's a glitch. Your devious cousin, Phillipe Montcroix, is trying to challenge your rule! Before the next meeting of the Noble Council, you need to deftly persuade at least 7 of ten nobles to side with your rule. Meantime, Phillipe will be attempting to undermine your efforts.

## Gameplay
- The character you chose will have beginning stats in
  - Charisma
  - Persuasiveness
  - Intelligence
  - Reputation
- During the gameplay, you will travel to at most 10 different noble houses within the realm to garner their support. Along the way, you can choose to help villagers (+reputation), visit certain locations to learn more about the things that matter most to the noble you are about to encounter (+intelligence), and learn tips and tricks that will improve your ability to persuade the nobel (+persuasiveness)
- You will be on your last several hundred currency, so you will need to be aware of what you spend. Phillipe has deeper pockets and will occasionally send operatives to:
  - Spread rumors (-reputation)
  - Argue against you (-persuasiveness)
- At the end of the the 10 in game days, the Noble Council will meet and will vote on supporting your or Phillipe's rule. If they vote for you, you win.
